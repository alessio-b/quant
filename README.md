### What is Quantum Computing
> Quantum computing is a computing paradigm that exploits Quantum mechanical properties (superposition, entaglement, interference...) of matter in order to do calculation

Even Modern Computers use **some** Properties from Quantum Mechanics, for example in a [SSD Memory Cell](https://youtu.be/5f2xOxRGKqk).  
But the diffrence is that in a Quantum Computer **only** use these Quantum mechanical properties.

As many think Quantum Computers are just faster Computers.  
This is **not** the Case, Quantum Computers or *Quantum Turing Machines* work diffrently from Normal Computers or *Turing Machines*.  

[Turing Machines](https://youtu.be/gJQTFhkhwPA) are Conceptual Models of the physical Computers.
Unlike the *Turing Machines*, *Quantum Turing Machines* have
